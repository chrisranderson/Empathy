==========

A website wrapper to help developers understand how people with accessibility issues experience their site.

This is brand, brand new. I'm not sure how I want code to be organized, and most everything I've written has been in a
whirlwind of "wow this is fun". That said, to get an idea:

    1. Clone the repo
    2. Open up demo/test.html
    3. Choose one of the versions of colorblindness
    
That's all that is working for right now.

Ideas / game plan
--------
- Blindness? Color blindness âœ“
- Low vision (macular degeneration, glaucoma, Diabetic retinopathy, cataracts)
- Hearing loss (mild to severe, high tone, low tone, deaf-blindness?)
- Motor disabilities (requiring tab navigation only, Parkinson's)
- Cognitive disorders? Scrambeled text, maybe


Todo:
- Fade in new image
- Pre-render color blindness
