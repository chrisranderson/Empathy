Ideas / game plan
--------
- Blindness? Maybe use TTS service to help with this.
- Low vision (macular degeneration, glaucoma, Diabetic retinopathy, cataracts)
- Hearing loss (mild to severe, high tone, low tone, deaf-blindness?)
- Motor disabilities (requiring tab navigation only, Parkinson's)
- Cognitive disorders? Scrambled text, maybe
