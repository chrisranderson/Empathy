Empathy
==========

A Chrome extension to help developers understand how people with colorblindness experience their site.

To use:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
3. Check the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right corner.
4. Load unpacked extension - give it the root directory for the repo.
5. Open a new tab, press ctrl+0 to reset zoom (doesn't work with zoom).
6. Click the yellow "e" extension button.
7. Choose a type of colorblindness, revert, choose another, revert, etc.

The extension will simulate types of colorblindness:

This is an old project, so I only recently updated it to restore the basic functionality. The "Compare to original" button currently does not work, so I removed it.
